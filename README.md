# Simple Spring Boot CRUD Rest API

## Information
- A simple Rest API using Spring Boot and Spring Data Rest dependency to practice my knowledge on this subject. 
- The Spring Data Rest Dependency implements "under the table" the basic API calls, only needing to use the JpaRepository for it.
- Just with this simple program we are able to execute GET, Post, Put and Delete calls to the API.
